# Tumblr Batch Photo Upload

Manually uploading pictures to tumblr sucks if you are trying to use it as a
photoblog (phlog?). Single photo posts are favorable to photosets (in my
opinion), so it takes forever to upload a shit ton of pictures, especially if
you have to retype the tags for each picture EVERY SINGLE TIME.

Use this.

## How To?

```
npm install
node index.js
```

You also need to set your auth tokens and keys inside a `.env` file. Checkout
`.env.sample` for more information, but just figure it out. It's not hard.
You're probably gonna have to [register an
application](https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps) first though.
